Hi there, 

I'm Nicolas. I used to be an audiologist, lecturer  at Toulouse 3 University and a CNRS researcher. I've changed path by becomming a data scientist.
My passions are travelling, tasting beers and also takling with people to exchange ideas.

### Contributions :

- [Hearing data]() : A web app to analyze NoaD database.
- [MEMAU](https://memau.eu/) : A web plateform dedicated to students in audiology. They can have access to final year projects in audiology but also different types of ressources
such as questionnaires, tools for statisticsand so on.
- [MEMAUDATA](https://data.memau.eu/) : Web app to fullfill audiological questionnaires and get the scores. Warning! On-going project!
